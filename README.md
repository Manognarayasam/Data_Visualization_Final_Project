# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization Final Project

## Project Overview
The US Accidents Dashboard is an interactive data visualization application built to analyze and uncover insights from over 2.25 million accident records across the United States. Leveraging the power of **Dash, Plotly, and Pandas**, this project transforms raw accident datasets into meaningful visual narratives for public safety analysis and informed decision-making.

The application enables users to identify accident-prone areas, analyze contributing weather and infrastructure factors, and visualize the trends from 2016 to 2023.

## Motivation & Problem Statement
While statistical methods exist for examining accident data, they often fall short of being intuitive for public use. This project addresses that gap by utilizing data visualization to:

- Assess the impact of infrastructure on severity

- Offer an accessible dashboard to different user groups

Despite existing safety efforts, traffic accidents remain prevalent due to poor weather, road conditions, and human error. Traditional accident datasets often bury useful insights. **This project transforms these datasets into rich, interactive visual formats to guide data-driven road safety initiatives.**
